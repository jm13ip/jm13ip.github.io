### Bio

I am a 2nd (and a half) Year IASC major. My primary research interest is in video games, both from a technical as well as artistic perspective. A certain element of that area of interest can be seen in my approach to the Research Presentation, where I compare the VideoNow format to GameBoy Video (which I decided not to make the central focus due to my lack of personal experience with it, unlike the VideoNow which I did have during my childhood). I have also had some significant first-hand experience as a critic of digital culture, as I was a "Pro-GG" advocate during the GamerGate controversy. During this event, I both defended gaming culture against accusations of supporting "widespread misogyny and harassment," as well as pushed for disclosure of potential conflicts of interest in gaming journalism (the latter of which, I still maintain to this day, was in fact the primary concern behind the hashtag movement). Because of the reactions to the (disingenuous) mainstream reporting concerning the motivations behind the movement, I noticed an extremely dichotomous attitude supported by an inherent bad faith model being demonstrated by an alarming majority of social justice advocates. This has subsequently lead me to treat sociopolitical movements of a similar nature with a high level of skepticism, as may be evident from my blog post. If I were to continue my career in digital humanities research exclusively, I would most likely use this portfolio primarily as a sample of my style of writing, as few of these subjects are directly correlated to my academic interests.

### Ying XOR Yang : A Rebuttal of Tara McPherson's "Why Are the Digital Humanities So White?"

**Abstract:** Dr. McPherson has asserted that the cause of the division between the social and technical aspects of the field of Digital Humanities research has stemmed from an inherently “modular” approach that is enforced by the underlying structure of the technical aspects of the subject. However, that is an unsatisfactory explanation, as “modularity” does not require the omission of crucial detail and nuance the way a “lenticular” lens does. In fact, it can be argued that McPherson herself operates with a lenticular point of view towards the subject of Digital Humanities within her own essay, because she shows no concern for the long-term consequences her “non-lenticular” policy may inadvertently bring.  Her tonality and general attitude suggest a push for the kind of study that #TransformDH seeks to create. Research suggests that it’s highly likely both Dr. McPherson’s essay and #TransformDH are symptomatic of the general push towards more traditional Humanities subject matter, which is resultant from migratory Humanities scholars facing reduced funding and resources. Subsequently, the relationship is not at all healthy between the two disciplines, as animosity from the more sociologically-centered scholars is quite evident to the more technologically-centered scholars. This hostility is then reflected onto the technically-minded scholars, particularly when the sociologically-minded scholars imply that the technically-focused digital humanities scholars have a “moral obligation” to shift the primary focus to the sociological aspects of digital humanities. This inability to see things from outside their "lenticular" point of view will likely result in mutual contempt and perpetual animosity if left unchallenged. 

**Research Process:** This paper went through a great number of revisions, largely due to the extremely sensitive nature of the subject matter, as well as the confusing rhetoric which the author employs throughout the work. It was clear through reading similar articles from the same source (Debates in the Digital Humanities) that these issues are still a major concern within the field of study, as well as the primary issue surrounding a grassroots hashtag campaign movement. It is difficult for me to avoid responding to “pro-diversity” appeals to emotion with pathos when I encounter such arguments, so my first few drafts were largely angry rants about how deceptive I perceived Dr. McPherson's rhetoric to be, despite me knowing that that was dangerously close to ad hominem. Nevertheless, I still desired to refute the points I saw as largely having been projected onto digital humanities rather than naturally existing. Eventually, I decided to focus on how I believed McPherson’s true motivation for seeing a more sociological approach to digital humanities could be a desire to make it more palatable for her traditional Humanities colleagues, pointing to Kirschenbaum and the Dark Side of Digital Humanities roundtable as evidence of the clear financial incentive for traditional Humanities to attempt to co-opt the digital. After receiving feedback, however, I realized I could be more persuasive if I focused more on the aspect of turning her own logic against her, as it hadn’t occurred to me that Dr. McPherson may not even be aware of just how alienating and divisive these political attitudes have become to the general public in recent years. I have therefore revised a good majority of the blog post to reflect this change in focus.
