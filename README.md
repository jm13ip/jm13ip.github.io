# IASC 2P02 | John Mattys

### Bio

I am an IASC major hoping to get into the gaming industry at some point later in my career, though currently I'm keeping my options open to avoid over-specializing without hands-on experience into what kind of role I want to take on. I put a high value on the importance of meaningful debate, and I make a conscious effort to consider the points of the opinion that is currently the least prevalent or popular, no matter how distasteful (in other words, playing the Devil's advocate), to at very least understand the viewpoints of the opposing side, as my personal philosophy is that people tend to stop criticizing their own ideas once everyone around them supports their position, as may become evident from my writings.
