### About Me

I am an IASC major hoping to get into the gaming industry at some point later in my career, though currently I'm keeping my options open to avoid over-specializing without hands-on experience into what kind of role I want to take on. Thus far in the 3 years I've been here (even though I'm currently finishing the missing credits from years 1 and 2 due to a bad reccomendation from the Student Services department) I have learned much that is relevant, and much that is not. I'm hoping when I finally get to year 3 I might finally get some practical experience and working prototypes in. I will say this course has definitely proved its worth, at least in terms of the basic understanding of GitHub it has provided me. I can imagine how this will be very useful to me in the future.

In terms of my academic attitude, I admit I tend to be exceptionally critical of pretty much everything presented to me, and I struggle with memorization of details I can't immediately connect to any other pre-existing knowledge. I tend to favour unpopular political opinions and positions on the basis of avoiding groupthink, which I have always loathed due to unfortunate experiences in my childhood with group dynamics and herd mentality leading to exceptional cruelty, a behaviour pattern I have seen repeated on increasingly grander scales throughout human history and society as I've matured. This viewpoint may be evident in many of my writings.
