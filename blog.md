## Ying XOR Yang : A Rebuttal of Tara McPherson's "Why Are the Digital Humanities So White?"

  Dr. Tara McPherson's essay _"Why are the Digital Humanities So White?"_ is a difficult essay to argue with. The thesis of her essay is delivered in a confusingly roundabout manner, as the author seems to struggle somewhat to find a common thread between her two passions. She acknowledges this, indirectly, when she writes, _"...we desperately need to close the gap between these two modes of inquiry,"_ and _"that the difficulties we encounter in knitting together our discussions of race... with our technological productions within the digital humanities... are actually an effect of the very designs of our technological systems."_ This makes the central premise of her argument- that the lenticular logic that is responsible division between the ethnicities is firmly embedded in the framework of digital technology itself- feel more like an afterthought than the central rhetorical point that the essay is built around. Therefore, I will also need to employ a somewhat indirect approach in order to effectively address all of her key points which I disagree with.

  Let me first address the argument which Dr. McPherson has dedicated the majority of the essay to, as can probably be inferred when looking at her most frequently used vocabulary: The issue of UNIX and the programming concepts that Dr. McPherson compares to systemic racial division (without ever directly connecting those two concepts).

  McPherson herself **does** state that _"...[she is] not arguing that the programmers creating UNIX at Bell Labs and in Berkeley were consciously encoding new modes of racism and racial understanding into digital systems. (Indeed, many of these programmers were themselves left-leaning hippies, and the overlaps between the counterculture and early computing culture run deep, as Fred Turner has illustrated.)"_ She later elaborates in a postscript annotation that _"There is no smoking gun that can unequivocally prove a one-to-one equation between shifting parameters of racial representation and racism and the emergence of UNIX as a very particular development in the history of computing, one that was neither necessary nor inevitable. Such proof is not my goal here."_ At the very least, I must commend Dr. McPherson for not falling into the mental trap of equating correlation with causation. Furthermore, I also do agree that it is useful to approach complicated issues from a more "big picture" perspective, looking past specializations to find common themes and concerns.  
  
  However, what happens when we examine McPherson's own essay with this "non-lenticular" lens? Look at what happens when we examine what words she associates with the words that represent the main focal points of her essay- "Unix," "race," and "digital:"

  Upon close inspection, it appears that, while she tends to put "digital" and "race" often in similar contexts, she doesn't appear to directly connect those concepts with the more technical subject of UNIX. Indeed, the sole connection between these concepts, other than a direct correlation between "race" and "digital," is the mutually shared word "work" between "digital" and "race." It's possible her very essay, therefore, must also be constructed in a modular framework in order for these concepts never to appear in the same sentence together. Indeed, the same logic could be argued of the differentiation between the paragraphs of her essay, which modularly group sentences (which themselves modularly group words in terms of subjects and predicates) in order to address specific topics and ideas united by a central theme. If she is truly advocating for a non-modular approach to academic studies, should she not employ that same philosophy in her own communicative structure? Why is it that she feels the need to distinguish between her ideas when they could all be used in a single, wholesome, big-picture run-on sentence? The reason is the same reason why modularity is such a universal concept in programming: It provides a _common framework_ to construct her ideas from. 
  
  The conceptual model of the human skeleton illustrates this principle: It is a (relatively) simple, rigidly defined, segmented structure that divides the body into distinct appendages and sub-appendages through its design. The independent bones do not, on their own, physically connect to each other, but they do correlate in form, some more strongly than others; indeed, many appear nearly identical to each other, and many have perfectly mirrored counterparts. Because of this, the skeleton does not accurately represent the actual appearance or attributes of the person to whom it belongs- it cannot, on its own, portray hair color, eye color, body weight, strength, intellect, race, or even gender (to the untrained eye). It is merely the inflexible, coherent structure which muscles, organs, veins, and nerves overlay, providing universal, static points of reference. The human body can then be organized into something much more complex that branches out from the skeleton, and it is from these branches that the actual connections (joints and muscles) emerge. If the bones were all directly physically connected, or if there were no bones at all, then movement and flexibility would be virtually impossible; therefore, the skeleton cannot help but be modular in nature. The same principle applies to architectural structures, sentence structures, programming structures, and, indeed, even social structures. That is why McPherson's argument against modularity is invalid- it is a critical misunderstanding of the underlying nature of modularity itself, as modularity does **not** necessitate the total incompatibility with specific detail and connections that lenticular logic requires, but instead is the basis from which complexity can be extrapolated upon.

 Additionally, there is an industry-wide perspective to consider as well. Within every major academic specialization are specialists, with their own specific needs and goals in mind. Relationships between similar specialized fields of study can be complementary (such as that between biology and chemistry), but at times they can be downright hostile (such as that between psychology and psychiatry). In either case, though, it is unusual to see widespread support for the total merging of these subjects. Normally, a separate interdisciplary study emerges to bridge the gap between the two main branch studies (such as biochemistry), or the lines between the two studies become hotly debated and rigidly defined (such as with psychology and psychiatry, as evidenced by the strictness of the legal definitions of the terms "psychologist" and "psychiatrist"). Yet in her essay, Dr. McPherson insists that Digital Humanities ought to merge its concerns and approaches with the traditional Humanities, rather than employ either of the aforementioned conventional solutions. To understand the reasoning behind taking this approach, therefore, I must ask: _Cui bono?_

  Kirschenbaum mentions in his essay _"What is Digital Humanities and What's It Doing in English Departments?"_ that he noticed a rather concerning trend in the field of study: _"Digital humanities has... lately been galvanized by a group of... graduate students, faculty members..., and other academic professionals who now **wield the label “digital humanities” instrumentally** amid an increasingly monstrous institutional terrain."_ He is not alone in this observation, as the roundtable proposal to the MLA for "The Dark Side of Digital Humanities" debate itself describes: _"The same neoliberal logic that informs the ongoing destruction of the mainstream humanities has encouraged foundations, corporations, and university administrations to devote new resources to the digital humanities... And because there is no sign that these funding streams are going to dry up any time soon, and no sign on the horizon of an increase in funding for the “crisis humanities,” there is great potential for increased tension between the “haves” of digital humanities and the “have-nots” of mainstream humanities."_ 

 Suffice it to say, therefore, that it seems there exists a financial incentive for traditional Humanities academics to "branch out" into Digital Humanities. Undoubtedly, this could lead to resentment due to the natural barrier-to-entry between these subjects from the less technically-oriented Humanities scholars. It is conceivable, therefore, that this may be the true source of the frustration Dr. McPherson describes feeling towards her inability to reconcile her passions. If so, she would by no means be the only one to have expressed these sort of sentiments. One need only read the manifesto of the "TransformDH" hashtag to see extremely similar desires being articulated, albeit much more strongly and directly:
  
1. "_Questions of race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability **should be central to digital humanities** and digital media studies._"
2. "_Feminist, queer, and antiracist activists, artists, and media-makers outside of academia are doing work that contributes to digital studies in all its forms. This work productively destabilizes the norms and standards of institutionally recognized academic work._"
3. "_We should **shift the focus of digital humanities from technical processes to political ones,** and always seek to understand the social, intellectual, economic, political, and personal impact of our digital practices as we develop them."_

This manifesto, however, appears to contradict that the claim that it is primarily a "modular mindset" that separates the Digital Humanities from the traditional. This is not at all a call to compromise and for the "big-picture, interdisciplinary" thinking that Dr. McPherson advocates for in her essay. Instead, it suggests a desire to co-opt Digital Humanities into accepting the overarching goals and ideals of traditional Humanities unilaterally, rather than coexisting in a non-lenticular fashion from within the study, or branching out into a separate, hybrid study (perhaps under the term "Digital Sociology," for example). Moreover, because the mindset being used in this manifesto is, ironically, lenticular in nature, it has failed to consider what impact these goals, if achieved, will have on existing Digital Humanities scholars with a highly technical approach, as well as those with a differing sociopolitical view than the hegemonic liberalism that currently dominates the Humanities: What would become of _their_ studies when the focus shifts? Would they be stripped of the title of "Digital Humanities" and relegated to a different discipline entirely? Or will they simply be kicked out with extreme prejudice? Is that not the very sort of lenticular approach that McPherson criticizes constantly throughout her essay? Furthermore, if #TransformDH **does** get their vision realized, then what will prevent Digital Humanities from suffering the same fate that the traditional Humanities are currently facing, once corporations realize that Digital Humanities graduates are not being taught the technical skills they assumed they would have?

  Therefore, in closing, I argue that Dr. McPherson's approach to this subject is uncomfortable to read for all the wrong reasons. She fails to appreciate that the reason that modularity in structures exists is not merely to simplify, but rather to provide a framework for nuance to emerge from. She claims that this "problem" of modularity can be resolved through priorities that appear as though they will ultimately result in an even more lenticular mindset becoming prevalent. Consequently, she and the similarly-minded #TransformDH activists inadvertently present this issue as an "exclusive or" decision between the technical Digital Humanities and the political Digital Humanities. In doing so, I fear that the Digital Humanities may one day have to firmly close its doors to traditional Humanities scholars who would rather have Digital Humanities transformed to suit them and their interests than to transform themselves to fit into the Digital Humanities. Otherwise, Digital Humanities risks becoming nothing more than the traditional Humanities operating under a different name. Digital Humanities doesn't **have** to be "one, or the other, but not both"- black XOR white; technical XOR political. Under these sort of circumstances, though, it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for these attitudes to coexist peacefully- and, sadly, no amount of "non-lenticular" thinking is going to heal that rift.
