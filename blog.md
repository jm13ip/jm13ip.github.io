## : A Rebuttal of Tara McPherson's "Why Are the Digital Humanities So White?"

  Tara McPherson's essay _"Why are the Digital Humanities So White?"_ is a difficult essay to argue with. First of all, there isn't even an immediately apparent thesis. The first three paragraphs of the essay don't even address the argument being presented, but instead recounts the author's own personal experiences and struggle to combine their newer interest in digital humanities with their long-standing passion for leftist political concerns. This serves only to confuse the reader as well as remove any pretense of academic neutrality. McPherson instead states her main thesis statements in the fourth paragraph: _"...[That] we desperately need to close the gap between these two modes of inquiry,_ and _"that the difficulties we encounter in knitting together our discussions of race... with our technological productions within the digital humanities... are actually an effect of the very designs of our technological systems."_ 

  Let us first address the argument which McPherson has dedicated the majority of the essay to, as can probably be inferred when you look at her most frequently used vocabulary: The issue of UNIX and the programming concepts that Ms. McPherson feels is, as her colleagues might say, "problematic."

  To be fair, McPherson herself **does** state that _"...[she is] not arguing that the programmers creating UNIX at Bell Labs and in Berkeley were consciously encoding new modes of racism and racial understanding into digital systems. (Indeed, many of these programmers were themselves left-leaning hippies, and the overlaps between the counterculture and early computing culture run deep, as Fred Turner has illustrated.)"_ That saves me the trouble of discrediting this association... although I can't understand why the author would bother wasting the reader's time with such an overly detailed analogy if it wasn't even meant to be supporting evidence. 

  This gets even more confusing in the annotations at the very end of the essay, where she elaborates: _"There is no smoking gun that can unequivocally prove a one-to-one equation between shifting parameters of racial representation and racism and the emergence of UNIX as a very particular development in the history of computing, one that was neither necessary nor inevitable. Such proof is not my goal here."_ Yet on the contrary, it **is** necessary for your entire premise to have any ground to stand on that you **actually have proof that supports your entire argument.** 

  You cannot simply leave it as an open question for the reader to decide for themselves in an **argument** piece- that goes against the entire purpose of even having an argument! Most humorously of all, she even concludes this annotation with a remark that, _"It has been interesting to note that, when presenting this work in various venues, scholars of race typically get the argument, while others are sometimes more resistant. I would suggest that perhaps this very resistance might itself be an after effect of the triumph of modularity in the contemporary academy."_ No, Ms. McPherson, it's not the "triumph of modularity" or "systemic racism" or "the patriarchy" that is causing resistance, it is the basic fact that your argument lacks any supporting evidence whatsoever and is unable to persuade anyone who does not already share your viewpoint. Without any real **evidence** to support the claims, the entire bulk of McPherson's essay ought to be dismissed as the product of confirmation bias seeking meaning in the meaningless and confusing correlation with causation. She didn't even make a solid connection between race and UNIX within the same context throughout this essay!

  However, the other main point of her argument- that there is a need to close the gap between the digital and political humanities- is a much more concerning assertion. The essay doesn't even attempt to provide any further elaboration on this point, as if the idea that digital humanities ought to merge with political humanities is a self-evident argument that is not in need of defense. However, I contend, in the strongest possible terms, that the digital humanities should **NOT** take on more political ideological content than is already present. In fact, the current amount is already too much.

  Kirschenbaum mentions in his essay _"What is Digital Humanities and What's It Doing in English Departments?"_ that he noticed a rather concerning trend in the field of study: _"Digital humanities has... lately been galvanized by a group of... graduate students, faculty members..., and other academic professionals who now **wield the label “digital humanities” instrumentally** amid an increasingly monstrous institutional terrain."_ He is not alone in this observation, as the roundtable proposal to the MLA for "The Dark Side of Digital Humanities" debate itself describes: _"The same neoliberal logic that informs the ongoing destruction of the mainstream humanities has encouraged foundations, corporations, and university administrations to devote new resources to the digital humanities... And because there is no sign that these funding streams are going to dry up any time soon, and no sign on the horizon of an increase in funding for the “crisis humanities,” there is great potential for increased tension between the “haves” of digital humanities and the “have-nots” of mainstream humanities."_ 

  This would certainly explain McPherson's desperation to draw these two fields of study together, although unfortunately in this context it also seems reasonable to assume that this essay may be a more passive-aggressive argument for coopting digital humanities into mainstream humanities. If so, she would certainly not be the only one; the hashtag movement "#transformDH" even goes so far as to **explicitly** advocate for the downplaying of the "digital" aspect of digital humanities and a higher focus on the subject matter the now-failing mainstream humanities continues to advocate for. One cursory glance at their manifesto leaves no ambiguity of their intent: 
  
1. "_Questions of race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability should be central to digital humanities and digital media studies._"
2. "_Feminist, queer, and antiracist activists, artists, and media-makers outside of academia are doing work that contributes to digital studies in all its forms. This work productively destabilizes the norms and standards of institutionally recognized academic work._"
3. "_We should shift the focus of digital humanities from technical processes to political ones, and always seek to understand the social, intellectual, economic, political, and personal impact of our digital practices as we develop them."_

What these individuals fail to realize, however, is that if they get their way and digital humanities is allowed to be reformed into traditional humanities, then there's a good likelihood that foundations, corporations, administrations, and even students will abandon the digital humanities for the same reasons that they have begun to abandon the traditional humanities. Frankly, I don't think even the most diehard neomarxists of the humanities would want that to happen. 

  Therefore, I argue, we should not entertain the political concerns and subject matters of the traditional humanities if we allow the same mistakes and fallacies to made. We cannot allow flimsy arguments with no supporting evidence to go unchallenged due to accusations of bigotry being used to silence discussion. We cannot allow cries for safe spaces, trigger warnings, and special pronouns to distract from our core concerns until they have appropriately proven themselves to be able to hold a mature, open, and honest debate like adults. The name-calling has to end, one way or another.
