## Confirmation Bias Runs Amok: A Criticism of Tara McPherson's "Why Are the Digital Humanities So White?"

A general trend I have increasingly noticed throughout my university studies here at Brock is a tendency for certain political viewpoints to end up seeping their way into the academic lessons being taught, with minimal actual debate or questioning of these ideas being highlighted or even acknowledged, and often in places where the subject matter has no immediate, obvious relevance to the material being taught. This is particularly glaring in McPherson's piece, which advocates over and over again how digital humanities ought to integrate itself more thoroughly with the "social justice" aspect of the humanities, inserting a very confusing and jargon-filled tirade about how the logic powering the UNIX operating system's modularity is analogous to segregation (or, to give her the benefit of the doubt, she may merely be juxtaposing these concepts due to their similar eras, though that in and of itself seems academically dubious, at best). 

She never goes quite so far as to DIRECTLY imply that UNIX is racist, though they do remain the central theme of her essay, despite never being DIRECTLY linked, as is illustrated by these Voyant visualizations of her text:

The entire essay, consequently, reads like a shrine to confirmation bias. This impression is reinforced by McPherson admitting she has a preoccupation with social justice topics, saying, _"...it seemed so hard to hold together my long-standing academic interests in race, gender, and certain modes of theoretical inquiry with... the world of digital production and design,"_ then admits that _"a workshop focused on the notion of tools and infrastructure[ might not be expected to have] such discussions,"_ and yet nevertheless immediately proceeds to declare that she intends to find a connection between the two subjects regardless. One has to wonder exactly how a paper with the author EXPLICITLY declares their intent to conflate two unrelated subjects ever survived peer review. Unless, of course, said peers are equally as guilty of desiring to insert political ideology into every subject matter possible.

However, is it fair to truly declare such subject matter to be TOTALLY unrelated to digital humanities? That's admittedly a difficult argument to make when the borders of digital humanitarian study are so ill-defined. Matthew Kirchenbaum writes, _"At its core, then, digital humanities is more akin to a common methodological outlook than an investment in any one specific set of texts or even technologies."_ Thus, without a clearly defined corpus to confine the subject to, theoretically any body of works using modern technologies that examines these subjects is fair game for inclusion in these studies. So, in that sense, it is not academically DISHONEST for McPherson to conflate these two subjects, per se, since those two COULD, at least in theory, be related. Whether or not "unintentional/unconscious" influence is acceptable evidence is admittedly an inherently subjective preference. However, that does not mean that the parallels inherently carry significance, and it is essential to remember how correlation is not the same as causation. Giving too much credence to these patterns is to leave the realms of respectable critical analysis and to venture into the murky territory of pseudoscience.

It should also be noted that McPherson is certainly not the only scholar guilty of this particular conflation. And her offense of a false equivalency pales in comparison to the manifesto of "#transformDH," which Moya Bailey et al have summarized as advocating the following beliefs:

" _1. Questions of race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability should be central to digital humanities and digital media studies._

  _2. Feminist, queer, and antiracist activists, artists, and media-makers outside of academia are doing work that contributes to digital studies in all its forms. This work productively destabilizes the norms and standards of institutionally recognized academic work._

  _3. We should shift the focus of digital humanities from technical processes to political ones, and always seek to understand the social, intellectual, economic, political, and personal impact of our digital practices as we develop them._"

This is pure, unadulterated social justice advocacy. There are already plenty of fields of study that will happily handle this subject matter, such as Gender Studies or (sadly) Psychology. There is no need to co-opt academic cultural study of technology into political ideology, and doing so would ultimately undermine what little credibility and respect the field of study has managed to garner. 

Institutional bigotry is a severe and very aggressive accusation, and as such ought to be subject to intense scrutiny of the evidence. When one has to resort to claiming that modularity is a product of "white" and "capitalist" thinking and therefore has to be "reimagined," you are no longer looking at race from a digital humanities perspective, but instead you are projecting social justice conspiracy theories into mechanical operations. This is not only damaging to the very causes you are trying to advocate for, but also to any discipline unfortunate enough to fall prey to this conformist mindset masquerading as "diversity."
